## Library of books from Calibre or elsewhere

This module started mainly on the technical aspects of using other databases with Xaraya in general, and accessing its tables via Dynamic Data Objects specifically.

The Calibre database with its many interlinked tables and its metadata.db sqlite database formed an interesting challenge to tackle this, and it led to a few changes in the Xaraya core and DD module to support this as well.

That you're able to navigate through books from different databases by author, series or tags is more a consequence of using the built-in DD capabilities, and little has been done to improve the user interface or customise the navigation at this point...

However, if you feel inspired, please don't hesitate to fork this module and submit pull requests, or even create another module with fancy new features :-)
